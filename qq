    feat(tubescraper): start implementing the build.
    
    As it stands, to build an image you add it to the compose file and
    docker/podman-compose build it. Tubescraper has a dependency on the
    "base_image" being built.  The builds have to re-lock the uv lockfile
    because they strip out the unused dependencies, like the dev dependencies
    at the top level.  Currently requires hard linking the uv lockfile to
    the application directory, manually.

    build: initial commit.
    
    The inital commit - hopefully works with minor modification.I can't
    stand conventional commits, but some people soy for them, so I'll use
    them. This commit sets up some infrastructure without documenting
    it in the README - there's process that needs to be defined and
    explained, too.
    
    We have a monorepo powered by uv - the root directory contains the
    dev dependencies while project directories define their own direct
    dependencies. The uv lockfile is at the project root to keep every
    library and application in sync.
    
    This monorepo will also contain Terraform code and Kubernetes
    manifests, as well as tooling to help deploy those. For that, the
    .github/CODEOWNERS file contains myself (ff-dh) and James Mcminn
    (jamesmcminn) as owners of the infrastructure and deployment
    directories so that if there's a change there, we're marked as
    reviewers.
